# About

This organization repository contains the code for the Kavach 2023 Grand Finale for the KVH-004 problem statement by the team Trailblazers.

The repositories are private for obvious reasons, but will be made public after the hackathon ends.


## Update 1

The repos will go public once code sanitization and documentation is done with extensive testing as we are planning to launch it as an open-source product.


## Update 2

Planning to rename PhishWarden and a Start-Up mainly focusing on Phishing Threats and it's defence. Will hopefully launch by December 2023.

### Stay Tuned!
